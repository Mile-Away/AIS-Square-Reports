Compared to the earlier released alpha version, the beta version has a more complete refactoring of the code, more comprehensive support for various model modules, optimized DPA2 model support for LAMMPS , and added more new features . V3.0.0b 3 version further fixes known bugs in v3.0.0b0 , v3.0.0b 1 and v3.0.0b 2, also passed systematic testing , and also released a DPA2 pre-training model for v3.0.0b 3 (see below) . Detailed feature support and optimization can be found in the release note:
  - https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases/tag/v3.0.0b0
  - https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases/tag/v3.0.0b1
  - https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases/tag/v3.0.0b2 
  - https://github.com/deepmodeling/deepmd-kit/releases/tag/v3.0.0b3 (recommended)
- ABACUS software releases version 3.7 update. The new version of ABACUS has been comprehensively tested for the alloy field to ensure the accuracy and pseudopotential reliability of the calculation. At the same time, in order to support the OpenLAM large atomic model plan, it has been deeply optimized to improve the performance on domestic DCU hardware, including memory utilization efficiency and calculation speed, further expanding its application scope in first-principles label calculation of large atomic models.

- Domain model
  - Free Energy Pertubation Model  (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09817) 
    - On NNP, using DPA-2 + semi-empirical method to achieve accuracy equivalent to DFT
    - A new NNP tuning molecular force field flow was designed, while ensuring the accuracy of the potential energy surface at the NNP level and the calculation efficiency at the MM level
  - Solid state battery
    - A large model of solid electrolyte pre-training DPA-SSE ( SSE-ABACUS dataset) was constructed. The energy accuracy predicted by the model is one order of magnitude higher than that of CHGNET and M3GNET, and the force accuracy is improved by 1-5 times. In terms of dynamic properties, the diffusion coefficient and conductivity of Li ions predicted by DPA-SSE have good consistency with the experiment.
    - Pre-training model of bulk materials (cholerates), online to arXiv ( http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18263 )
    - Dedicated app for developing pre-training models for solid electrolytes ( https://bohrium.dp.tech/apps/voltcraft )
  - Alloy
    - A pre-trained large atomic model of the alloy containing 53 elements was constructed, and first-principles calculations were performed using domestic abacus software and DCU machines to generate 24,000 data. The configurations include elemental, compound, high-entropy alloy crystal structures, vacancy, self-interstitial, surface defect structures, etc. The pressure range is - 0.5-5 GPa, and the temperature range is 50-3000 K. The energy accuracy of the trained model can be less than 35 meV/atom, and the force accuracy can be less than 0.25 eV/Ã–.
    - Compared with the existing MACE pre-trained large atomic model, the developed alloy domain model performs better in properties such as elastic constant, modulus, surface energy, and point defect formation energy.
  - High pressure hydrogen rich compound
    - An atomic-scale model suitable for predicting the structure of high-pressure hydrogen-rich superconducting compounds (including 152702 datasets, 29 elements of ternary hydrogen-rich compounds, covering a pressure range of 150-250 GPa) was constructed.
    - The DPA-1 model is based on the 2024Q1 version and can currently stably optimize the structures of 28 known hydrogen-rich superconducting compounds, and the spatial groups before and after optimization are consistent. ( https://www.aissquare.com/models/detail?pageType=models&name=High-Pressure-Hydrogen-Rich-Compound&id=258 )
  - Dynamic catalysis
    - A general potential function model DPA-DynaCat for dynamic catalytic elementary reactions on cluster surfaces was preliminarily constructed, and its training dataset includes common small molecule-related elementary reactions such as H2/O2/H2O/CO/CO2/CH4 occurring on the surface of Au/Ag/Cu/Pt/Pd/Ni pure metals and binary alloy clusters.
    - Compared with the results of DFT calculation, the model can accurately predict the potential energy surface, and can obtain an approximate reaction free energy compared with the Machine Learning potential function for a single system. This model can be combined with molecular dynamics for enhanced sampling, considering the contribution of each isomer in the reaction process, and can be used to calculate the reaction energy barrier and reaction free energy.

## Community
- The Periodic Table Crystal Structure Philatelic Competition officially kicked off on July 1st. This will be a long-term and effective competition aimed at providing a testing and iterative platform for crystal structure search and generation algorithms, while providing a richer chemical space for OpenLAM updates. See ( https://bohrium.dp.tech/competitions/8821838186?tab=introduce ) for details.
- Based on the Crystal Structure Philatelic Contest, the OPENLAM crystal structure database has been constructed, which currently includes more than 500,000 stable structures. All structures in the database can be accessed through the official API ( https://github.com/deepmodeling/openlam ); In order to promote the effective connection between the language and perspective of experimental scientists and the current artificial intelligence technology and database progress, we have developed the Crystal Craft APP ( https://bohrium.dp.tech/apps/crystalcraft ), which provides more possibilities for experimental scientists to consider element replacement and template structures based on crystal symmetry in terms of structure retrieval and generation.
